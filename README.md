# Predicting Housing Prices

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project is to use machine learning techniques for regression in order to predict the prices of homes given a kaggle training dataset with 80 features. Some of the machine learning algorithms explored throughout this project include linear regression, XGBoost, and Voting Regressor. Some of the evaluation metrics used to evaluate the perfromance of each model tested include R2, accuracy score, MSE, RMSE, and MAPE.

## Import Libraries:

Some of the necessary python libraries for this project include:

- Numpy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn
